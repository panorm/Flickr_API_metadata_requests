# Flickr_API_requests
This repository contains R scripts to retrieve Flickr image metadata using both search terms or geographic extent.
The script was adapted from one written by Chelsey Walden-Schreiner (https://github.com/cwaldenschreiner/geotag) 
and uses the RCurl, rjson and RJSONIO packages.

Both of these scripts require a API key and secret which are available from https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/
