# Flickr_API_metadata_requests
This repository contains R scripts to retrieve Flickr image metadata using both search terms or geographic extent.
The script was adapted from one written by Chelsey Walden-Schreiner (https://github.com/cwaldenschreiner/geotag), which in turn originated
from Fredheim, R. (2015). Digital data collection course retrieved from http://www.r-bloggers.com/digital-data-collection-course/. 
These scripts use the RCurl, rjson and RJSONIO packages.

Both scripts require a API key and secret which are available from https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/
